# LOTHProject

This program is used to load, view, print, and save various canonical hours from the Liturgy of the Hours. The original intention was simply to create a way to the print pages from the [Divinum Officium](https://divinumofficium.com/) website, however I ended up expanding it to include many extra uses. To download, please go to the [release page](https://github.com/TheCardinalSystem/LOTHProject/releases/latest).
